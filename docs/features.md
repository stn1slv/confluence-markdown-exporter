# Features

Exports individual pages, pages with descendants, or entire spaces via the Atlassian API. Skips unchanged pages by default, re-exporting only what has changed since the last run.

## Supported Confluence features

### Content & formatting

- **Rich text**: headings, paragraphs, bold, italic, underline, lists, tables, links, images, attachments, and image captions
- **Page links**: links to Confluence pages become relative Markdown links, whether they were inserted as page links, pasted as full page URLs, or pasted as tiny links (`/wiki/x/...`, the "Copy link" shortlink)
- **Code blocks**: language-aware fenced code blocks
- **Task lists**: checkboxes with completion state
- **Text highlights & font colours**: preserved with inline HTML colour styling
- **Status badges**: converted to coloured inline highlights
- **Info / note / tip / warning panels**: converted to Markdown alert blocks (`[!NOTE]`, `[!TIP]`, …)
- **Comments**: open inline and/or page-level (footer) comments exported as sidecar files next to each page
- **Include / excerpt-include macros**: embedded pages either inlined or exported as Obsidian transclusion links (`![[Page Title]]`)

### Page metadata

- **Page properties**: Page Properties macro exported as YAML front matter, [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) inline fields, or [Meta Bind](https://www.moritzjung.dev/obsidian-meta-bind-plugin-docs/) VIEW fields; duplicate keys are disambiguated automatically (configurable via [`export.page_properties_format`](./configuration/options.md#exportpage_properties_format))
- **Page Properties Report**: dynamic cross-page property tables exported as a static snapshot or a live [Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) DQL query (configurable via [`export.page_properties_report_format`](./configuration/options.md#exportpage_properties_report_format)). Reports nested inside a third-party app macro (for example [Table Filter](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/27447/table-filter-charts-spreadsheets-for-confluence)) are also exported. Note that such apps apply their filtering, sorting and column hiding in the browser, and that behaviour is not available through the API, so the export contains the full unfiltered report.
- **Page labels**: exported as `tags` in YAML front matter

### Diagrams & add-ons

- **[draw.io](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1210933/draw-io-diagrams-uml-bpmn-aws-erd-flowcharts)**: diagram files saved as attachments; embedded Mermaid diagrams extracted as fenced Mermaid blocks
- **[PlantUML](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1222993/flowchart-plantuml-diagrams-for-confluence)**: exported as fenced PlantUML code blocks, both the Server/Data Center macro (`plantuml`) and the Cloud macro (`plantumlcloud`); the diagram source is exported, not the rendered image
- **[Markdown Extensions](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1215703/markdown-extensions-for-confluence)**: pass-through of raw Markdown macro content
